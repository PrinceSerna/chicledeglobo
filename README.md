# chicledefresa-zsh 🍬 

The initial file was created by making mods here, and there. Then I just kept making mods ⇢ 🤔😅

That being said; to use you'll first need:
[Oh My Zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/)

## HOWTO [kindda]

1. grab `chicledefresa-zsh-theme` from this repository
2. slap in your Oh-My-Zsh theme directory: `~/.oh-my-zsh/themes/`
3. scribbles: `ZSH_THEME='chicledefresa'` in your `~/.zshrc` file
4. lastly, reload your terminal by running: `zsh`
